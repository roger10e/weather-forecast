## Functionality

Users can type in the name of a city and press the search button. If the city is a real city recognized by the API, then the name of the city, along with today's date, will be displayed. 

Along with that data, the day's weather forecast (temp, wind speed, humidity, UV index, and weather icon) will display in the main section.

Below the main section is a series of cards with the five-day forecast for that city.

Searched cities are saved in the sidebar and are able to be clicked to bring their data back into the display.

## Upcoming Changes

* Make sure the saved list is functioning properly
* Add a double-check just in case the city the user enters is not valid
* Add other checks, and make the code tighter by instituting loops where appropriate
